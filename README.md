# Pedestrian-Detection-using-Open-CV

 This project basically performs pedestrian detection using the OpenCV library and the Python programming language.

The OpenCV library actually ships with a pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM detector based on the Dalal and Triggs method to automatically detect pedestrians in images.
